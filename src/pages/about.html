  The organization, named the "Ghost Squad," was formed by a group of former
  military and mercenary personnel who were disillusioned with the corrupt and
  inefficient systems of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). They saw piracy as a
  means to acquire the resources and wealth necessary to fund their own
  operations and achieve their goals of creating a new, more just society in the
  stars.
  <br /><br />
  The Ghost Squad operates as a loosely organized network of independent cells,
  each with its own leader and agenda. Some cells engage in acts of piracy,
  hijacking ships and raiding cargo to acquire the resources and technology
  necessary for their goals. Others provide support and protection to the pirate
  cells, using their expertise in tactics, technology, and espionage to
  outmaneuver UEE forces.
  <br /><br />
  Despite their criminal activities, the Ghost Squad has gained a significant
  following among those who see them as a symbol of resistance against the
  oppressive UEE. The Collective is also known for its code of honor, which
  requires its members to treat their hostages humanely and to never attack
  civilian targets.
  <br /><br />
  The UEE has declared war on the Ghost Squad, and the two sides are locked in a
  brutal struggle for control of the galaxy. With their superior technology and
  resources, the UEE has the upper hand, but the Collective's cunning and
  tenacity make them a formidable adversary.
  <br /><br />
  As the war rages on, the Ghost Squad continues to attract new members and gain
  support, cementing its status as one of the most feared and respected
  organizations in the galaxy.
