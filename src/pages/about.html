<span class="about-content">
  The organization, named the "Ghost Squadron - Air and Ground" (GSAG) was
  formed by a group of former military and mercenary personnel who were
  disillusioned with the corrupt and inefficient systems of the United Empire of
  Earth (UEE). They saw piracy as a means to acquire the resources and wealth
  necessary to fund their own operations and achieve their goals of creating a
  new, more just society in the stars.
  <br /><br />
  GSAG operates as a loosely organized network of independent cells, each with
  its own leader and agenda. Some cells engage in acts of piracy, hijacking
  ships and raiding cargo to acquire the resources and technology necessary for
  their goals. Others provide support and protection to the pirate cells, using
  their expertise in tactics, technology, and espionage to outmaneuver UEE
  forces.
  <br /><br />
  Despite their criminal activities, GSAG has gained a significant following
  among those who see them as a symbol of resistance against the oppressive UEE.
  The Collective is also known for its code of honor, which requires its members
  to treat their hostages humanely and to never attack civilian targets.
  <br /><br />
  The UEE has declared war on GSAG, and the two sides are locked in a brutal
  struggle for control of the galaxy. With their superior technology and
  resources, the UEE has the upper hand, but the Collective's cunning and
  tenacity make them a formidable adversary.
  <br /><br />
  As the war rages on, GSAG continues to attract new members and gain support,
  cementing its status as one of the most feared and respected organizations in
  the galaxy.
