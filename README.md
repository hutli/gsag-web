# GSAG web
Star Citizen Org "Ghost Squadron - Air and Ground" (GSAG) official website.

## Build/Deploy
GSAG web is a static website and does therefore not need to be build.
The `Makefile` copies all files from `src` into a directory hosted by a standard webserver.
The used `nginx.conf` is very standard but has been included for convinience/reference.
